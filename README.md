# browser dom confetti

This is a packaged version of [Daniel Lundin](https://github.com/daniel-lundin)'s [dom-confetti](https://github.com/daniel-lundin/dom-confetti) module. All credit goes to the original dev for putting this together. The purpose of this project is simply to get this into a state that can be used directly by a client app, and to make it available in a CDN.
